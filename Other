1nt structure: 
Garbage only if we pass! 1nt - 2cl - 2d - 2h = invite cu h and sp
1nt - 2cl - 2NT both min, 3cl both max - responder transfers

4 way transfers

1nt - 3cl = minors weak
1nt - 3d = strong
1nt - 3h / sp = singleton 5-4-3-1

Todiscuss from here:

1NT – 4d/h transfer; 1NT – 4cl 5-5MM; with 6-4 2cl - 2d - 4oM

1NT – 2cl – 2M – 3 OM = slam try with a shortness; 4cl = KC in the major; 4d = slam try no shortness

same over 1NT – transfer – accept – 3 OM / 4cl / 4d

1NT – 2cl – 2d – 3m = gf 6 minor and 4 of a major

1 NT – 2h – 2sp – 3H = slam try 55 (?); 1NT – 2d – 2h – 2sp GF 55 (?)




Over 2cl:

2cl - 2d - 3 M 4 M + 5 d
2cl - 2d - 2h Kokish
2cl - 2d - 2h - 3h 6sp, no heart fit, probably bad spades
2cl - 2M / 3cl = good suit, proposes the suit, in principle nothing much outside
2cl – 2d – 2h – 3cl weak cl / 3d weak d
2cl - 2d - 2h - 2sp - 2nt 24-25
2cl - 2d - 3NT 26-27. Then Baron (4cl - 4NT = cl)
2cl - 2d - 2h - 3NT = 28+



When we bid 3NT over their preempt: 4cl range ask with 3 answers (cue = bal very strong, 4NT = bal normal, suit = suit). 3nt - 4cl - 4M after 3cl opening = 5 cards


4NT jump when not having a fit: 
 1sp - 2cl - 2sp - 3cl - 3sp - 4NT keycards (3sp promises extra spades)
 1h - 2cl - 3cl - 4NT quantitative
With minors: we bid 4m for the fit, then cue, then KC

1h - 1sp - 2d - 3d - 3h - 3sp - 4d not forcing. We can stop in 4m if we don't have the stopper. But 2d - 3d - 4d = forcing

Suit, then cue : ambiguous, shows a hand that can't make other bids.

1d - 1h - 2d - 2sp stopper (suggests no club stopper) / 2NT natural game forcing
1d - 1h - 2d - 2NT game forcing; 1d - 1h - 2d - 3d game forcing
1d - 1h - 2d - 3cl invite with fit or game forcing no fit (usually I have my own major)
1d - 1M - 2d - 3d - 3NT semibal with stoppers, minimal; 3h = club stopper, 3sp = spade stopper. 
1d - 1M - 2d - 3d - 4d = good diamonds, unbalanced, not a NT hand



To discuss: 

If responder is strong in any of these sequences: do not bid 4d. Bid cuebids. Except 3NT - 4d asks for club cuebid
1cl - 1 x - 2cl - same things as above


2d, 2h, 2sp - 4cl = KC, 0/1/1+Q/2/2+Q?


On singletons - low / high / none; copy the 1cl - 1sp - 3d / 3h


3NT serious, or non-serious, in any position?

1d - 1M - 2d - 2NT forcing? 1d - 1M - 2d - 3cl = ? 1d - 1M - 2d - 4d, or 1d - 1M - 2d - 3cl - 3d - 4d =? Same concept, we can play kickback and this sequence a qualitative invite. Same over 1cl 



Slam double

3 way hydra: 1cl - 1M - 2d a) natural inverted b) zone 3 6 cl c) 15-18 6cl and 3M. Responder always bids 2M weak, relays with 2 OM, all else gf. Responder bids 3d / 3cl / something else than 3d and 3cl with the 15-18 hand (2NT / 3M natural) 

1d – (2nt) = cl and h. 1d - (3d) = MM.  1d - (2d) = diamonds. 1cl 2 cards - (2cl) clubs.

Over 1NT opening, strong/weak. Strong : “multi” (2d = 1 major, 2M = 5-4+ with m, 2cl = MM). Weak : 2cl MM, dbl pen, pass forcing up to 2h including, double takeout

Support double up to 2h including?
ELC up to 4 level?
2 way CK when a single opponent bids once at 1 level?
DONT when they double our 1NT: 1 any – (1NT) – dbl. 2sp = spades competitive, “better” than rdbl. 

1NT – (dbl) for pen : rdbl business, pass to play, transfers, 2cl weak cl.

1 cl – (1NT) – 2cl to play, 2d H, 2h S, 2sp clubs nebal, 2NT minors. 1d – (1NT) – 2cl to play 2d, 2d H, 2h S, 2sp d nebal, 2 NT minors.
1H – (1NT) – 2cl = 2H and 5+ sp ; 2d = h constructive ; 2h = h weak ; 2sp = just sp. 2NT = fit 4+ nebal.
1S – (1NT) – 2cl = 2sp and 5+ h, 2d = h, 2h = sp constructive, 2sp = sp, 2NT = fit 4+ nebal

First double is takeout, except against 2 suiters. E.g.
1h – (2NT) – dbl – (any) – later double = penalty.
1h – (2NT) – pass – (any) – p – (p) – dbl = penalty 
1NT – (2cl majors) : dbl takeout, can be light. 2NT leb (3M after is to play!); 2h/s = cl/d. 3m = gf. 3M = stopper.
1NT – (2d one major) : dbl = h ; 2h = sp ; rest sys on.

Defense 2d multi : dbl = 13-15 bal or 16+, dbl is takeout. Pas + 2NT = minors.

Leaping Michaels, forcing but does not promise we will make game
