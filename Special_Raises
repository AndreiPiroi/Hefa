To discuss 1cl - 1d/h/s - 2cl, the ones below aren't clearly better than natural
To discuss 1d - 1M - 2d - 2M/2OM/3cl
To discuss 3 way hydra: 1cl - 1M - 2d a) natural inverted b) zone 3 6 cl c) 15-18 6cl and 3M. Responder always bids 2M weak, relays with 2 OM, all else gf. Responder bids 3d / 3cl / something else than 3d and 3cl with the 15-18 hand (2NT / 3M natural) 
To discuss 1d - 1M - 2NT versus 1cl - 1M - 2NT
