To discuss: rdbl = no stopper no major; suit = stopper and JUST that suit; 
2NT = MM with stopper; 3cl = MM without stopper (if garbage, we play 3h or 3sp) 
pas = all else - responder redoubles and opener bids a major in transfer (note that we can still play 2h garbage from the right hand)

Over dbl on 2h / 2sp: accept = stopper (we don't know the fit), pass = no stopper but fit; 2sp over h / 2nt over sp = fit 4 without stopper; 3M = fit 4 with stopper
rdbl = no stopper no fit
