2NT 20-21 (and 2cl - 2d - 2NT 22-23, 2cl - 2d - 2h - 2NT 24+)

3cl Puppet, 3d/h transfer with super accept

3sp transfer to 3nt (!)
2nt - 3nt 5sp 4h (!), just game, non forcing

2nt - 3cl - 3d - 4cl/d = 44 MM slam try (opener bids 4d when strong)/ just game
2nd - 3cl - 3d - 4m natural
2nt - 3cl - 3M - 3 sp/4h slam try with fit
2nt - 3cl - 3M - 4m natural

2nt - 3s - 3nt - 4m = slam try other minor (!)
2nt - 3s - 3nt - 4h/sp = slam try 54 / 45
2nt - 4d/h transfers
2nt - 4cl 6-4MM just game

First step over 4m = I hate it, rest answers KCs
